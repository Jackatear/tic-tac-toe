Player 1 is X
Player 2 is O

Player 1 {
    Marker: X
    Played = 0
    win = 0
}

PLayer 2 { 
    Marker = 0
    played = 0
    win = 0
}

whosTurn {
    whosTurn.c = 0
    if x%2 == 0:
        whosTurn.marker = x
    else
}


gridArray =>

[ 0, 1, 2,
  3, 4, 5,
  6, 7, 8  ]

when a tile is clicked, we change the corrosponding element in the grid to that 'marker'

How to check if win:

HORIZONTALS -> 123 or 345 or 456 
VERTICALS -> 036 or 147 or 258
DIAGONALS -> 148 or 246

once a player.played >= 3 we can run the check functions
